# qt-main-feedstock

This is a meta package for Qt6 which installs the components found in `qtbase`, `qttools`, `qtwebsockets`,
`qtwebchannel`, and a few other Qt libraries and tools. Prior to Qt6, these individual packages were all a part of
`qt-main` and so this meta package remains for backwards compatibility.
